\section{Results}

Each \Cyclus result is shown as a solid line, and the excel solution in the
benchmark \cite{feng_standardized_2016} is shown as a dotted line for visualization. The results are
simply a reproduction of the plots displayed in the benchmark \cite{feng_standardized_2016}. The excel
results are obtained by personal contact with the benchmark \cite{feng_standardized_2016} first author
Bo Feng at Argonne National Laboratory.


Figure \ref{fig:pow_plot} shows the deployed reactor capacity.
The \gls{LWR} retirement and \gls{SFR} deployment timeseries are shown
in figure \ref{fig:dep}. The two plots show exact agreement with the
excel solutions from the benchmark \cite{feng_standardized_2016}.

The annual fuel loading rates are shown in table \ref{fig:fuel_load}.
The initial fuel loading for 100 \gls{LWR} reactors were edited to match
the plot in the verification
study results. Note the oscillations for the \gls{LWR} fuel loading
is caused by the refueling period being 18-month refuel cycle for all \gls{LWR} reactors
aggregated into 12-month groups. Note also that the total values
are equal for both plots.

Although indistinguishable,
there is a small difference with \gls{SFR} fuel loading, proportional
to the core mass difference, as mentioned in the previous section.
Figure \ref{fig:fuel_load_diff_norm} shows the
differences normalized by the core mass differences, overlapped with the
\gls{SFR} deployment. This shows that the differences only occur during
deployment due to the difference in core mass.

    \label{fig:fuel_load}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:fuel_discharge_monthly} shows the inventory of discharged
\gls{UNF} in mandatory cooling stage. It also oscillates between the excel 
solution,and converges, caused by the influx and the outflux of \gls{UNF}
into and out of the storage facility.
Note that for most plots the \gls{SFR} inventory and fuel loading
exactly matches the excel solutions, minus the small difference due to core
size.

\end{figure}


Similar results are shown in figure \ref{fig:waiting_monthly} for the inventory of discharge fuel cooled and waiting
for reprocessing.
Unlike the previous plot, however, the oscillation peaks meet with the excel
solution.  This is because cooled inventory is measured by the cumulative sum
of fuel that has been cooled subtracted by the fuel reprocessed at that timestep.
The cooled inventory before the fuel are sent to reprocessing, which correspond
to the peaks in the oscillation, are the cooled inventory defined by the benchmark \cite{feng_standardized_2016}.

\end{figure}


Figure \ref{fig:rep} shows the reprocessing throughput, which also oscillates between
the excel solution. Note that no oscillation exists in the beginning because the
\gls{LWR} reprocessing plant throughput is maximized at 2,000 tons per year.

    \label{fig:rep}
\end{figure}


Figure \ref{fig:tru} shows the inventory of unused \gls{TRU} recovered from \gls{UNF}.
The \Cyclus results follows the excel solutions closely. However, the difference
in core size causes \Cyclus results to be smaller, since more \gls{TRU} is used to
start up the newly deployed \glspl{SFR}. The difference decreases as the
\glspl{SFR} decommission, discharging more \gls{UNF} (thus \gls{TRU}) than
the benchmark.
