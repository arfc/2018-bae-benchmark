obtained from the first simulation. The following
values are the EU inventory and history at year 2050.

To create \gls{MOX}, 10\% Pu and 90\% depleted uranium is used.
Thus $1,761$ tons of plutonium yields $17,611$ tons of
\gls{MOX}. Table \ref{tab:pu} lists the isotope, mass fraction,
and quantity that can be obtained from the 2050 \gls{SNF} inventory.


\subsection{French \gls{SFR} Transition Scenario}

From Varaine et al \cite{varaine_pre-conceptual_2012}, a French
ASTRID-type \gls{SFR} of capacity $600 MWe$ needs $1.225$ tons of
plutonium a year, with an initial plutonium loading of $4.9$ tons.
Thus, it can be assumed that the ASTRID reactor takes in $49$ tons of 
\gls{MOX}, and refuels a quarter of its fuel every year. Simply,
an ASTRID reactor needs $12.25$ tons of \gls{MOX} per year. 

The number of SFR-years worth of fuel that can be created with
the \gls{SNF} from 2050 is $\frac{17,611.3 t}{12.25} = 1,437.65 $.
Assuming infinite reprocessing and \gls{MOX} fabrication capacity,

However, assuming that \gls{MOX} can be recycled indefinitely,
spent \gls{MOX} from an ASTRID reactor
contains enough plutonium to produce a \gls{MOX} fuel with
the same mass, if mixed with depleted uranium. For example,
spent \gls{MOX} from an ASTRID reactor is 38\% plutonium,
whereas a fresh \gls{MOX} is 10\% plutonium. Separating plutonium
from spent \gls{MOX} from an ASTRID reactor can create \gls{MOX} more than
three times the mass of spent \gls{MOX}.

Case II was run, with the tails and spent \gls{UOX}
inventory, to evaluate if the French can transition into \gls{SFR}
without constructing additional \gls{LWR}s. This simulation
assumed infinite reprocessing and fabrication capacity.

Figures \ref{fig:sfr_num} and \ref{fig:sfr_cap} display
the \gls{SFR} number and capacity over time.
The sharp increase from 2035 to 2060 is due mainly to
French aggressive growth from 1975 to 2000.

Figure \ref{fig:fuel} shows the mass of \gls{MOX} used in the 
\gls{SFR}s separated by how they are made, over time.
Note that the mass of \gls{MOX} from the spent \gls{UOX}
stops increasing around 2050, which means that the spent
\gls{MOX} is enough to create the \gls{MOX} for the
\gls{SFR} fleet.
