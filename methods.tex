\section{Methodology}

The validation paper \cite{feng_standardized_2016}
has comprehensive simulation parameters that allows
us to reproduce the transition scenario in \Cyclus.
In thisstudy, we used the \Cycamore \cite{huff_fundamental_2016}
 archetype library to model
all fuel cycle facilities. \Cycamore libraries contain
simple fuel cycle facility models. For example,
the Reactor module does depletion calculations through
user-defined recipes.

\Cyclus outputs files in either \texttt{.sqlite} or
\texttt{.h5} format. In this study, we used the 
\texttt{.sqlite} format and analyzed the output file
using a python script.

The input file and analysis procedures are all in
[zenodo].

\subsection{Fundamental Code Differences in \Cyclus}

\Cyclus is different than some fuel cycle analysis codes
used in the paper, which led to some differences in the result.

\Cyclus' default timestep is a month. In order to take
this into account, most results are post-processed
to have an annual value (i.e. average value for
inventory calculations and sum of 12 months for
throughput calculations). The timestep in \Cyclus
can be changed into a year without changing the input
file, but \Cyclus' timestep execution \ref{fig:time} causes a delay
in the material flow.

\Cyclus, since it is an agent-based simulator, has discrete
execution steps per timestep that might cause delays or contort
the results from other simulators.

The \Cycamore recipe reactor depletes half of its core when decommissioned,
whereas the codes in the paper deplete all its fuel. This causes a major
discrepancy for \gls{TRU} inventory and flux. For this study, the \Cycamore
source code is changed to deplete all its assemblies to the depleted recipe.
Also, the \Cycamore recipe reactor treats each batch (and assembly) as a discrete
material, while some codes have continuous fuel discharge. This produces
differences in the results because the batches in the paper are in fractions.

Note that all the differences could have been mediated by changing the
archetype source code. However, the only change made was the reactor
depletion behavior at decommission due to its large impact. Note that this
study is done to show current \Cyclus agreement with other codes and identify
differences, not to alter \Cyclus to match the other codes.
