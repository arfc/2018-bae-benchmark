\section{Methodology}

Feng et al. comprehensively defines simulation parameters
sufficient to reproduce the transition scenario in \Cyclus.
In this study, we used the \Cycamore \cite{huff_fundamental_2016}
 archetype library to model
all fuel cycle facilities. \Cycamore libraries contain
simple fuel cycle facility models. 

The \Cyclus input file and analysis procedures are all
openly available in \cite{bae_arfc/transition-scenarios:_2018}.
\Cyclus results are output in either \texttt{.sqlite} or
\texttt{.h5} format. In this study, we used the
\texttt{.sqlite} format and analyzed the results
using a python script. We then compared the post-processed
output data to the results with the
model solution from the verification study \cite{feng_standardized_2016}.

The analysis and benchmark were performed iteratively,
where we improve the original result by communicating
with the authors of the benchmark. 
We analyzed the reasons for the differences from the original
result. Only one adjustment to the default reactor depletion modeling behavior 
was needed, regarding fuel handling upon reactor decommissioning.
Major differences in the facility behavior algorithms did not require 
adjustment. All model heuristics contributing to minor deviations from the 
benchmark are explained in detail.
