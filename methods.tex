\section{Methodology}

The validation paper \cite{feng_standardized_2016}
has comprehensive simulation parameters that allows
reproduction of the transition scenario in \Cyclus.
In this study, we used the \Cycamore \cite{huff_fundamental_2016}
 archetype library to model
all fuel cycle facilities. \Cycamore libraries contain
simple fuel cycle facility models. For example,
the Reactor module does depletion calculations through
user-defined recipes.

\Cyclus outputs files in either \texttt{.sqlite} or
\texttt{.h5} format. In this study, we used the
\texttt{.sqlite} format and analyzed the output file
using a python script. After post-processing of the
output data, we overlap the results with the
paper's solutions for comparison.

The input file and analysis procedures are all in
[zenodo].

The analysis and benchmark is performed iteratively,
where the original result is improved by communication
with the authors of the paper. From the original result,
the reasons for the differences were analyzed and
small edits in the source code were made accordingly.
Major differences in the source code are not edited but
simply explained in detail as to how they contribute
to the difference.
