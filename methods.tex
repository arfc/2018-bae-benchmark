\section{Methodology}

Feng et al. comprehensively defines simulation parameters
sufficient to reproduce the transition scenario in \Cyclus.
In this study, we used the \Cycamore \cite{huff_fundamental_2016}
 archetype library to model
all fuel cycle facilities. \Cycamore libraries contain
simple fuel cycle facility models. 

\Cyclus outputs files in either \texttt{.sqlite} or
\texttt{.h5} format. In this study, we used the
\texttt{.sqlite} format and analyzed the output file
using a python script. After post-processing the
output data, we overlap the results with the
benchmark's solutions for comparison. The input file
and analysis procedures are all in [zenodo].

The analysis and benchmark is performed iteratively,
where the we improve the original result by communicating
with the authors of the benchmark. 
We analyzed the reasons for the differences from the original
result, and made small edits in the source code.
Major differences in the facility behavior algorithms were not edited but
simply explained in detail as to how they contribute
to the difference in the results.
