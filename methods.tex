\section{Methodology}

Feng et al. comprehensively defines simulation parameters
sufficient to reproduce the transition scenario in \Cyclus.
In this study, we used the \Cycamore \cite{huff_fundamental_2016}
 archetype library to model
all fuel cycle facilities. \Cycamore libraries contain
simple fuel cycle facility models. 

The \Cyclus input file and analysis procedures are all
openly available in \cite{bae_arfc/transition-scenarios:_2018}.
\Cyclus results are output in either \texttt{.sqlite} or
\texttt{.h5} format. In this study, we used the
\texttt{.sqlite} format and analyzed the results
using a python script. The post-processed
output data was overlapped with the results with the
model solution from the verification study \cite{feng_standardized_2016}.

The analysis and benchmark were performed iteratively,
where we improve the original result by communicating
with the authors of the benchmark. 
We analyzed the reasons for the differences from the original
result, and made small edit in the reactor depletion modeling behavior
when the reactors are decommissioned.
Major differences in the facility behavior algorithms were not edited but
simply explained in detail as to how they contributed
to the difference in the results.
