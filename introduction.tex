\section{Introduction}
Fuel cycle simulators guide and inform \gls{NFC} research directions and policy choices.
Various institutions have developed fuel cycle simulators targeted at their unique needs,
using different methods and different structures
to simulate the material flow in the \gls{NFC}.
Algorithmic differences make
validation studies necessary to establish
confidence in software capabilities and
agreement amongst analysis tools.

A previous verification study \cite{feng_standardized_2016} compared
four well-known \gls{NFC} simulators
DYMOND \cite{yacout_modeling_2005},
VISION \cite{jacobson_verifiable_2010},
ORION \cite{gregg_analysis_2012}, and
MARKAL \cite{shay_epa_2006}. The results from each simulation tool
were compared to a set of `model solutions' that were generated
from an excel worksheet for different metrics (e.g. fuel loading in reactor,
\gls{UNF} inventory) in a transition scenario, and showed excellent agreement
with the result from the Feng et. al \cite{feng_standardized_2016}.

The present work benchmarks the \Cyclus nuclear fuel cycle simulator 
\cite{huff_fundamental_2014}
against the verification study results from Feng et. al 
\cite{feng_standardized_2016}.
Using the scenario definitions established in that validation study,
this work uses \Cyclus and its additional modules library, \Cycamore, to simulate the test case: a transition scenario from an
open fuel cycle to an advanced fuel cycle with
reprocessing. We accordingly compared the Feng et. al `model solutions'
to the \Cyclus and the results show excellent agreement.


\subsection{\Cyclus}

\Cyclus is an agent-based fuel cycle simulation framework 
\cite{huff_fundamental_2016}, meaning 
that each reactor, reprocessing plant, fuel fabrication plant, and other fuel cycle
facility is modeled as a discrete entity.
A \Cyclus simulation contains prototypes, fuel cycle facilities with
pre-defined parameters, that are deployed as \texttt{facility} agents.
\texttt{Institution} and \texttt{Region} agents manage the \texttt{Facility} agents.
A \texttt{region} agent holds a set of \texttt{Institution}s.
An \texttt{Institution} agent can deploy or decommission \texttt{Facility} agents.
Several versions of \texttt{Institution}
and \texttt{Region} exist, varying in complexity and functions \cite{huff_extensions_2014}.
 \texttt{DeployInst} is used as the \texttt{Institution} archetype for this work, where it
deploys facilities at user-defined timesteps.
