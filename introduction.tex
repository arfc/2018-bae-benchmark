\section{Introduction}
This paper uses Cyclus, the agent-based simulator \cite{huff_fundamental_2016}, to track
nuclear energy in the EU region. This paper focuses on different scenarios of France,
and how the French legislation and policy can change the nuclear landscape of the European
Union. This paper starts off by doing a generic once through fuel cycle, where all the fuel,
after discharge, goes to a central repository. Next, a reprocessing fuel cycle is evaluated,
where only the French \gls{PWR}s accept \gls{MOX} fuel, while taking all the spent \gls{UOX}
fuel from everywhere in the EU. Finally, a EG01-EG23 transition scenario \cite{wigeland_nuclear_2014},
where a once-through-cycle transitions to a closed cycle with reprocessing and \gls{SFR}s. 

\section{Methodology}
This study mainly utilizes Cyclus, an agent-based simulator, to simulate the fuel cycle
and track material flows in the EU countries. An open-source data is acquired from \gls{IAEA}
\gls{PRIS} as a csv file, listing the country, reactor unit, type, net capacity (MWe), status,
operator, construction date, first criticality date, first grid date, commercial date, shutdown
date (if applicable), and unit capacity factor for 2013. Then only the EU countries are extracted
from the csv file. A python script is written up to generate a Cyclus input file from the csv file,
which lists the individual reactor units as agents. The fuel cycle scenario is defined by modifying
the input file, and the Cyclus simulation is run. Another python script is written to analyze the 
output file, which is in SQL format. Different plots are generated with matplotlib that lists the 
output data from the simulation. Output data includes uranium mass mined, final used nuclear fuel
inventory, and major isotope mass over time.


\subsection{Depletion Calculations}
Depletion calculations of the nuclear fuel are done
naively, with a model burnup depletion recipe (mass fraction) used
for each reactor type, and the mass of the fuel 
adjusted linearly with capacity. For example, a PWR of
1,000 MWe capacity would have 193 assemblies of 4\% enriched
uranium fuel, with each assembly having a mass of 523.4 kg.
The core will have a 18 month cycle, where one-third of the 
core (64 assemblies) are discharged per refueling. The refueling
is assumed to take 2 months to complete, during which the reactor
is shut down. The discharged
assemblies would have a radioisotope inventory of a reference
depletion calculation from ORIGEN (see appendix).


\subsection{Simulation specifics}
The simulation simplifies the front end of the fuel cycle,
where a 'source' provides the \gls{UOX} fuel and the natural
uranium fuel, for the \gls{MAGNOX} case. Then, the fuel is
irradiated and sent to the sink upon discharge. The discharged
fuel inventory is measured by isotope as a timeseries.
