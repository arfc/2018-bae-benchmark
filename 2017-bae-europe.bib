	abstract = {As nuclear power expands, technical, economic, political, and environmental analyses of nuclear fuel cycles by simulators increase in importance. To date, however, current tools are often fleet-based rather than discrete and restrictively licensed rather than open source. Each of these choices presents a challenge to modeling fidelity, generality, efficiency, robustness, and scientific transparency. The Cyclus nuclear fuel cycle simulator framework and its modeling ecosystem incorporate modern insights from simulation science and software architecture to solve these problems so that challenges in nuclear fuel cycle analysis can be better addressed. A summary of the Cyclus fuel cycle simulator framework and its modeling ecosystem are presented. Additionally, the implementation of each is discussed in the context of motivating challenges in nuclear fuel cycle simulation. Finally, the current capabilities of Cyclus are demonstrated for both open and closed fuel cycles.},

	abstract = {The symbiotic equilibrium between 1.51 GWe breeder SFR (Sodium Fast Reactors) and 1.6 GWe EPR™ (European Pressurized water Reactors) is studied. EPR™ are only supplied with MOX (Mixed OXide) fuel to avoid the use of natural uranium. The equilibrium is studied by considering the flows of plutonium. Its isotopic composition is here described by a single real number referred to as the Pu grade. Plutonium flows through both reactor types are characterized by using linear functions of the Pu grade in new fuels. These functions have been determined by fitting data from a former scenario study carried out with the COSI6 simulation software.
Two different reprocessing strategies are considered. With joint reprocessing of all spent fuels, total and fissile plutonium flows balance for a unique fraction x of EPR™ in the fleet, equal to 0.2547. This x value is consistent with the results reported in the former scenario study mentioned above. When EPR™ spent fuels are used in priority to supply SFR (distinct reprocessing), x reaches 0.2582 at most. COSI6 simulations have been performed to further assess these results. The EPR™ fraction in the fleet at symbiotic equilibrium barely depends on the applied reprocessing strategy, so that the more flexible joint reprocessing constitutes the reference option in that case.},

	abstract = {Management of spent fuel from commercial nuclear reactors is a key issue for many NEA
member countries. As interim storage facilities in many countries reach their design capacities,
the need to optimise spent fuel storage management is becoming an increasingly important
issue to managing fuel cycle costs while reducing associated risks. In nuclear criticality safety
studies involving spent fuel, burn-up credit is being pursued and has been implemented in many
countries as a means of more accurately and realistically determining the system reactivity by
taking into account a decrease in the reactivity of spent fuel during irradiation. Implementation
of burn-up credit has gained in world-wide interest during the last 20 years and it represents one
of the most technically challenging issues in nuclear criticality safety. To address these challenges
and help co-ordinate activities in NEA member countries, the Working Party on Nuclear
Criticality Safety (WPNCS) of the OECD/NEA Nuclear Science Committee (NSC) has organised the
Expert Group on Burn-up Credit Criticality (EGBUC). The decision of many countries to advance
burn-up credit as part of their criticality safety licensing strategy has heightened interest in
measurement data needed to validate code calculations for a burn-up credit methodology.},

	abstract = {The International Atomic Energy Agency is giving continuous attention to the collection,
analysis and exchange of information on issues of back-end of the nuclear fuel cycle, an
important part of the nuclear fuel cycle. Reprocessing of spent fuel arising from nuclear
power production is one of the strategies for the back end of the fuel cycle. As a major
fraction of spent fuel is made up of uranium, chemical reprocessing of spent fuel would leave
behind large quantities of separated uranium which is designated as reprocessed uranium
(RepU). Reprocessing of spent fuel could form a crucial part of future fuel cycle
methodologies, which currently aim to separate and recover plutonium and minor actinides.
The use of reprocessed uranium (RepU) and plutonium reduces the overall environmental
impact of the entire fuel cycle. Environmental considerations will be important in determining
the future growth of nuclear energy. It should be emphasized that the recycling of fissile
materials not only reduces the toxicity and volumes of waste from the back end of the fuel
cycle; it also reduces requirements for fresh milling and mill tailings. In comparison, the
method of direct disposal of spent fuel premeditates creation of larger capacity repositories for
permanent disposal. The issue of recycle and reuse of valuable material is important for the
nuclear fuel cycle in the context of sustainable growth of the nuclear energy. Recognizing the
importance of this subject, the International Atomic Energy Agency initiated the preparation
of this report to review and summarize information available on the management of
reprocessed uranium.},

power around the world. We begin with a discussion of the ‘but for’ baseline and the
much discussed ‘nuclear renaissance.’ Our pre-Fukushima benchmark for growth in
nuclear generation in the U.S. and other developed countries is much more modest than
many bullish forecasts of a big renaissance in new capacity may have suggested. For at
least the next decade in developed countries, it is composed primarily of life extensions
for many existing reactors, modest uprates of existing reactors as their licenses are
extended, and modest levels of new construction. The majority of forecasted new
construction is centered in China, Russia and the former states of the FSU, India and
South Korea. In analyzing the impact of Fukushima, we break the effect down into two
categories: the impact on existing plants, and the impact on the construction of new units.
In both cases, we argue that the accident at Fukushima will contribute to a reduction in
future trends in the expansion of nuclear energy, but at this time these effects appear to be
quite modest at the global level.},

	shorttitle = {Politics and {Nuclear} {Power}},
	abstract = {With the dramatic changes OPEC precipitated in the structure of world energy markets during the 1970s, energy became a central concern to policymakers throughout the industrialized West. This book ex-amines the responses of public officials in three leading European nations -- the Federal Republic of Germany, France, and the Netherlands -- to the energy crisis. As the study shows, the proposed energy programs in the three countries shared remarkable similarities; yet the policy outcomes were very different. To explain why, Michael T. Hatch goes beyond the specific content of government energy policy to include an analysis of the policymaking process itself.At the heart of the study is an exploration of the various dimensions of nuclear policy in West Germany. The political consensus on nuclear power that prevailed in the initial years following the energy crisis disintegrated as antinuclear "citizens' initiatives," the courts, and trade unions, as well as the traditional political parties, entered the policymaking process. Subsequent government efforts to resolve the political stalemate over nuclear power foundered in a morass of domestic electoral politics and an international debate over nuclear proliferation.Extending the analysis to comparisons with French and Dutch nuclear strategies, Hatch argues that the critical factor in determining nuclear policy was the manner in which the political system structured the nuclear debate. In contrast to West Germany, where the electoral and parliamentary systems enhanced the influence of the antinuclear "Greens," the electoral system and constellation of political parties in France served to dissipate the influence of the antinuclear forces. Thus in France the nuclear program en-countered few impediments. In the Netherlands, as in West Germany, government policy was paralyzed in the face of antinuclear sentiment across a broad spectrum of Dutch society.Hatch has provided here not only a useful examination of the development of energy policy in western Europe but also a case study of the close interplay between policy and politics.},

	abstract = {The symbiotic equilibrium between 1.51 GWe breeder SFR (Sodium Fast Reactors) and 1.6 GWe EPR™ (European Pressurized water Reactors) is studied. EPR™ are only supplied with MOX (Mixed OXide) fuel to avoid the use of natural uranium. The equilibrium is studied by considering the flows of plutonium. Its isotopic composition is here described by a single real number referred to as the Pu grade. Plutonium flows through both reactor types are characterized by using linear functions of the Pu grade in new fuels. These functions have been determined by fitting data from a former scenario study carried out with the COSI6 simulation software.
Two different reprocessing strategies are considered. With joint reprocessing of all spent fuels, total and fissile plutonium flows balance for a unique fraction x of EPR™ in the fleet, equal to 0.2547. This x value is consistent with the results reported in the former scenario study mentioned above. When EPR™ spent fuels are used in priority to supply SFR (distinct reprocessing), x reaches 0.2582 at most. COSI6 simulations have been performed to further assess these results. The EPR™ fraction in the fleet at symbiotic equilibrium barely depends on the applied reprocessing strategy, so that the more flexible joint reprocessing constitutes the reference option in that case.},
