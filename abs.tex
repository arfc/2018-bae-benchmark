Many nuclear fuel cycle simulators can analyze transitions from once-through to 
advanced nuclear fuel cycles. Verification studies compare various fuel 
cycle analysis tools to test agreement and identify sources of difference.  A 
recent verification study, B. Feng et al., ``Standardized verification of fuel 
cycle modeling,'' Annals of Nuclear Energy, vol. 94, pp. 300-312, Aug.  2016 
\cite{feng_standardized_2016} established transition scenario test case 
specifications and accordingly evaluated national laboratory nuclear fuel cycle 
simulators, DYMOND, VISION, ORION, and  MARKAL.  This work verifies the 
performance of \Cyclus, the agent-based, open-source fuel cycle simulator, 
using the test case specifications in Feng et. al.  In this work, \Cyclus 
demonstrates agreement with the results from the previous verification study. 
Minor differences reflect intentional, detailed material tracking in the 
\Cycamore reactor module.  These results extend the example results in Feng et. 
al to further enable future verification of additional nuclear fuel cycle 
simulation tools.
