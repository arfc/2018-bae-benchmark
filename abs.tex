Many nuclear fuel cycle system modeling codes
can analyze transition
from a once-through to an advanced nuclear
fuel cycle. Verification studies compare various
fuel cycle analysis tools to
test agreement and identify sources of difference.
This paper benchmarks \Cyclus, the agent-based,
open-source fuel cycle simulation code, against
a verification study \cite{feng_standardized_2016} for
DYMOND \cite{yacout_modeling_2005},
VISION \cite{jacobson_verifiable_2010},
ORION \cite{gregg_analysis_2012}, and
MARKAL \cite{shay_epa_2006}. This study reveals
that \Cyclus is in agreement with the results from the previous
verification study, with minor differences caused by
reactor module behavior.
