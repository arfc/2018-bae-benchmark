Many nuclear fuel cycle system modeling codes
can analyze transition
from a once-through to an advanced nuclear
fuel cycle. Verification studies compare various
fuel cycle analysis tools to
test agreement and identify sources of difference.
This paper benchmarks \Cyclus, the agent-based,
open-source fuel cycle simulation code, against
a recent verification study, B. Feng et al., ``Standardized verification of 
fuel cycle modeling,'' Annals of Nuclear Energy, vol. 94, pp. 300â€“312, Aug. 
2016 \cite{feng_standardized_2016} which evaluated fuel cycle simulators, DYMOND
VISION,
ORION, and  
MARKAL. The present work reveals
that \Cyclus is in agreement with the results from the previous
verification study, with minor differences caused by
reactor module behavior.
