	abstract = {Many countries produce significant quantities of nuclear waste which will have to be permanently and safely placed in a repository. We develop a mixed integer program that determines where to place each waste package of a specific waste type in a given time period with the goal of minimizing heat load concentration within a repository. Operational constraints include: (1) heat load limitations, (2) location and time at which waste packages can be placed, and (3) the number of waste packages that must be placed based on type and time period. Although applicable to other settings, we use the Yucca Mountain repository in Nevada as a case study. Each of the three objectives used for minimizing heat load concentration improves upon existing greedy and sequential filling methods. Existing filling methods give at least a 17 \% to an 873 \% higher, i.e., worse, heat load concentration in the repository with respect to these objectives than do optimal methods. Enhancements, i.e., symmetry reduction constraints, perturbations, and heuristics, increase the size of solvable problem instances. This research can be applied to any deep geologic repository planned for operation around the world with slight modifications to incorporate site-specific objectives and constraints.},

	abstract = {Sustainable development requires measures to decrease energy consumption and to avoid any harmful impact on the environment. In recent years, a lot of research has been focused on designing energy systems by emulating the natural ones. This can be regarded as a novel way to support the transformation to sustainable energy systems. The initial step in forming energy systems of thus type, by emulating the ecosystem approach, is the development of a model for rendering the current situation. To contribute to the solution of this problem, an ecosystem model combining the analysis, optimisation and simulation modules has been developed as part of this study. The commonly used models for energy systems are good predictors of the general energy dynamics and structures. However, they can be inadequate when it comes to describing or predicting the complex phenomena within energy systems, such as the large number of parameters, the many end-users, the potential of the technologies, the assessment of the various environmental impacts and the variety of resources. With the implementation of the ecosystem model there is further expanding of the knowledge of an advanced, self-organising methodology integrated within the model’s operation by emulating the natural system dynamics. The ecosystem model could become a valuable tool for developing sustainable energy systems, and allowing the development of the most suitable and sustainable energy system based on the local availability of energy sources.},

	abstract = {A nuclear fuel cycle systems modeling and code-to-code comparison effort was coordinated across multiple national laboratories to verify the tools needed to perform fuel cycle analyses of the transition from a once-through nuclear fuel cycle to a sustainable potential future fuel cycle. For this verification study, a simplified example transition scenario was developed to serve as a test case for the four systems codes involved (DYMOND, VISION, ORION, and MARKAL), each used by a different laboratory participant. In addition, all participants produced spreadsheet solutions for the test case to check all the mass flows and reactor/facility profiles on a year-by-year basis throughout the simulation period. The test case specifications describe a transition from the current US fleet of light water reactors to a future fleet of sodium-cooled fast reactors that continuously recycle transuranic elements as fuel. After several initial coordinated modeling and calculation attempts, it was revealed that most of the differences in code results were not due to different code algorithms or calculation approaches, but due to different interpretations of the input specifications among the analysts. Therefore, the specifications for the test case itself were iteratively updated to remove ambiguity and to help calibrate interpretations. In addition, a few corrections and modifications were made to the codes as well, which led to excellent agreement between all codes and spreadsheets for this test case. Although no fuel cycle transition analysis codes matched the spreadsheet results exactly, all remaining differences in the results were due to fundamental differences in code structure and/or were thoroughly explained. The specifications and example results are provided so that they can be used to verify additional codes in the future for such fuel cycle transition scenarios.},

	abstract = {The UK Government has made a commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 80\% from 1990 levels by 2050. Achieving this goal may demand a significant expansion of nuclear power and the Government has been exploring some very challenging scenarios with up to 75 GWe of nuclear capacity by 2050. Prior to establishing a national R\&amp;D programme, the Government commissioned the National Nuclear Laboratory (NNL) and the Dalton Nuclear Institute (DNI) to lead a preliminary R\&amp;D programme to fill in some gaps that have been identified. This initial R\&amp;D included a programme of work on Strategic Assessment, which will look at possible future energy and nuclear deployment scenarios to identify the important constraints and limitations. The nuclear expansion scenarios envisage a new build programme based on a Light Water Reactor (LWR) fleet and in some of these scenarios the LWRs are at some point replaced by a fleet of fast reactors with recycle that would allow a self-sustaining fuel cycle independent of world uranium supplies. This paper focuses on the high level conclusions that arise from the fast reactor scenarios studied. The high level conclusions relate to constraints on timescales for expansion of nuclear capacity and technical specifications for fuel cycle and waste management plants. In particular the work illustrates how the driving factors for fast reactor deployment have changed since the UK was last involved seriously in fast reactor development work in the mid-1990s.},

2.5    Ahn Models[1, 2]Basic Flowthrough Path Waste canisters are modelled as compartments of waste matrix surrounded by a buffer layer which is in turn surrounded by layers of near field rock and far field rock. Water is introduced to the system at a constant rate, and encounters an array of failed waste packages (at t = 0 in the 2004 model, and at Tf = 75,000 years in the 2007 model). The water immediately begins dissolving the waste matrix. Nuclides with higher solubilities are preferentially dissolved and treated with a ‘congruent release’ model discussed below. Nuclides with lower solubilities are transported through the buffer with the alternative ‘solubility limited release model. The water flow begins at one waste package and travels through the matrix and buffer space to the next waste package, contacting each waste package consecutively and then flowing on into the near field. In this way, the water is increasingly contaminated as its path through the waste packages proceeds.Congruent Release Model    Nuclides with a high solubility coefficient are modeled with the congruent release model. Nuclides of this type include most of the fission products, but not the actinides. This model states that the release from the waste packages is congruent with the dissolution of the waste matrix and is transported through the rock by advective transfer with the water that flows through the waste packages.Solubility Limited Release Model Nuclides with lower solubility coeffi- cients are modeled with the solubility limited release model. Solubility values6are assumed from TSPA for this model, and a solubility of 5 × 1−2[mol/m3] are taken to be ‘low.’ Elements in this ‘low’ category include the toxic actinides such as Zr, Nb, Sn, Th, and Ra. This model suggests that a dominant mode of dissolution of the nuclide into the flowthrough water is dominated instead by the diffusion coefficient, which is largely dependent upon the concentration gradient between the waste matrix and the water. The mass balance driving nuclide release takes the form:m ̇i =8ǫDeSiL⬚⬚Ur0    (2) πDewhere ǫ, U, r0, and L are the geometric and hydrogeologic factors porosity, water velocity, waste package radius, and waste package length, repsectively. De is the diffusion coefficient (m2/yr) of the element e and Si is the isotope’s solubility (kg/m3).},

Each of these choices presents a challenge to modeling fidelity, generality, efficiency, robustness, and scientific transparency. The Cyclus nuclear fuel cycle simulator framework and its modeling ecosystem incorporate modern insights from simulation science and software architecture to solve these problems so that challenges in nuclear fuel cycle analysis can be better addressed. A summary of the Cyclus fuel cycle simulator framework and its modeling ecosystem are presented. Additionally, the implementation of each is discussed in the context of motivating challenges in nuclear fuel cycle simulation. Finally, the current capabilities of Cyclus are demonstrated for both open and closed fuel cycles.},

	abstract = {Dynamic fuel cycle simulation tools are intended to model holistic transient nuclear fuel cycle scenarios. As with all simulation tools, fuel cycle simulators require verification through unit tests, benchmark cases, and integral tests. Model validation is a vital aspect, as well. Although comparative studies have been performed, there is no comprehensive unit test and benchmark library for fuel cycle simulator tools. The objective of this paper is to identify some of the “must test” functionalities of a fuel cycle simulator tool within the context of specific problems of interest to the Fuel Cycle Options Campaign within the U.S. Department of Energy’s Office of Nuclear Energy (DOE-NE). This paper identifies the features needed to cover the range of promising fuel cycle options identified in the DOE-NE Fuel Cycle Evaluation and Screening and categorizes these features to facilitate prioritization. Features are categorized as essential functions, integrating features, and exemplary capabilities. A library of unit tests applicable to each of the essential functions should be developed as future work. An international dialog on the functionalities and standard test methods for fuel cycle simulator tools is encouraged.},

	abstract = {This article presents an overview and a flavour of almost two decades of MARKAL model developments and selected applications. The MARKAL family of models has been contributing to energy/environmental planning since the early J980’s. Under the auspices of the International Energy Agency’s (IEA) Energy Technology Systems Analysis Programme (ETSAP) the model started as a linear programming (LP) application focused strictly on the integrated assessment of energy systems. It was followed by a non-linear programming (NLP) formulation which combines the ‘bottom-up’ technology model with a ‘top-down’ simplified macro-economic model. In recent years, the family was enlarged by members to model material flows, to employ stochastic programming (SP) to address future uncertainties, to model endogenous technology learning using mixed integer programming (MIP) techniques, and to model multiple regions (NLP/LP).},

	abstract = {Environmental issues and dependence on fossil fuel sources including coal, oil, and natural gas, are the two most prevalent energy issues that are currently faced by the United States. Incorporation of renewable energy sources, a non-economical option in electricity generation compared to conventional sources that burn fossil fuels, promises a viable solution for both of these issues single-handedly. Several energy policies have concordantly been suggested to reduce the financial burden of adopting renewable energy technologies and make such technologies competitive with conventional sources throughout the US. In this work, we present a novel simulation framework to help policymakers assess and evaluate policies from different perspectives of its stakeholders. The proposed framework is composed of four modules: (1) a database which collates the economic, operational, and environmental data; (2) elucidation of policy which devises the policy for the simulation model; (3) a preliminary analysis which makes predictions for consumption, supply, and prices; and (4) a simulation model. After the validity of the proposed framework is demonstrated, a series of planned Florida renewable energy policies are implemented into our framework as a case study. The results obtained from the simulation and conclusions drawn on the assessment of current energy policies are presented with respect to the conflicting objectives of different stakeholders.},
