\section{Fundamental Modeling Differences in \Cyclus}

\Cyclus has fundamental code differences from the fuel cycle analysis codes
used in the benchmark \cite{feng_standardized_2016}.

\Cyclus has a default timestep of a month.
The verification study solutions are evaluated with annual resolution, so cumulative and annual averages
were used.
For example, decommissioning of
facilities occurs at the end of a timestep, and building of facilities
occurs at the beginning of a timestep.

The \Cycamore recipe reactor depletes half of its core when decommissioned,
whereas the codes in the benchmark \cite{feng_standardized_2016} deplete all their reactors' fuel when decommissioned.
This causes a major
discrepancy for the \gls{TRU} inventory. For this study, we changed
the \Cycamore source code to deplete all its assemblies to the depleted recipe.
Also, the \Cycamore recipe reactor treats each batch (and assembly) as a discrete
material, while some codes have continuous fuel discharge. This produces
differences in the results because the batches in the benchmark \cite{feng_standardized_2016} are in time-averaged values.
In this study, the \gls{LWR} batch size and cycle time is increased, while
decreasing the batch number to keep the core size constant. We simply round
up the \gls{SFR} batch number, while the batch size and cycle time are kept constant.
This increases the core size by $1.08 \%$, which is negligible, but will be
discussed in the results section.
The differences are listed in table \ref{tab:diff}.

        \textbf{Category} & \textbf{Model Solution \cite{feng_standardized_2016}} & \textbf{\Cyclus} \\
        \hline
        LWR Batches & 4.5 & 3 \\
        LWR Batch size [tHM] & 19.91 & 29.86 \\
        LWR Core size [tHM] & 89.59 & 89.59 \\
        LWR Cycle time & 1 year & 1.5 years \\
        SFR Batches & 3.96 & 4 \\
        SFR Batch size [tHM] & 3.95 & 3.95 \\
        SFR Core size [tHM] & 15.63 & 15.8 \\
        \hline
        \end{tabularx}
        \label{tab:diff}
\end {table}

Note that all these differences could have been mediated by changing the
archetype source code. However, the only change made was the reactor
depletion behavior at decommission due to its large impact on plutonium inventory.
The goal of this
study is to show current \Cyclus agreement with other codes and identify
differences, not to alter \Cyclus to match the other codes.
