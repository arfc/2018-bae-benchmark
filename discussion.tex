\section{Discussion}

We benchmarked \Cyclus, the agent-based
fuel cycle simulator with results from another
verification study and saw good agreement
in a transition scenario.

Throughout this work, two major differences were identified
that led to the deviation
of \Cyclus results to that of the excel sheet. First,
the \Cycamore reactor depletes only half of its core
when decommissioned. Second, \Cyclus, unlike other
codes examined in the benchmark (except ORION), only has
discrete batches for fuel discharge.
We change the first issue by changing one line in the source code.
However, we did not change the
second issue intentionally to show that the final results
still match the benchmark solutions.

This study proves \Cyclus as a capable tool for modeling
fuel cycle transition scenarios, and shows promise for
expansion and future development.
