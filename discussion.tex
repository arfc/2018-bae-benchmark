\section{Discussion}

\Cyclus, the agent-based fuel cycle simulator,
has been benchmarked against other fuel cycle
simulators with good agreement.

Throughout this work, two major differences were identified
that led to the deviation
of \Cyclus results to that of the excel sheet. First,
the \Cycamore reactor depletes only half of its core
when decommissioned. Second, \Cyclus, unlike other
codes examined in the benchmark (except ORION), only has
discrete batches for fuel discharge.
The first differences was mediated by changing one line in
the source code. The second was not changed intentionally
to show that the final results are without the changes.

This study proves \Cyclus as a capable tool for modeling
fuel cycle transition scenarios, and shows promise for
expansion and future development.
