\section{Discussion}

We benchmarked \Cyclus with results from an established
verification study and saw good agreement
in a transition scenario.

Throughout this work, two major differences were identified
that led to the deviation
of \Cyclus results from that of the benchmark solution. First,
the \Cycamore reactor depletes only half of its core
when decommissioned. Second, \Cyclus, unlike other
codes examined in the benchmark (except ORION), fully resolves
discrete batches for fuel discharge.
We resolve the first discrepancy by changing one line in the source code.

This study proves \Cyclus as a capable tool for modeling
fuel cycle transition scenarios, and shows promise for
expansion and future development.
